# Jumper
Are you ready to test your mental skills? In this game you have to be accurate with your guesses, otherwise you'll fall to the cold hard ground. Don't loose hope! Only you have the power to keep your parachute in one piece and working to land safely. The game is simple, we show you a random secret word and you must guess it letter by letter. If you succeed, you win the game, but if you guess wrong 4 times, your parachute breaks and you lose. Are you ready to play?
